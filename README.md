# Checklist-go

This is a simple Go project created as part of my journey to learn the Go programming language. The project is a basic To-Do List application that allows users to add tasks, list tasks, mark tasks as completed, and exit the application.

## Features:
- Add Task: Add a new task to the To-Do list.

- List Tasks: View all tasks and their completion status.

- Mark Task as Completed: Mark a task as completed by its ID.

- Exit: Exit the application.
